Shortly after the group's lineup solidified in 1961, a series of wildly successful singles made them superstars, and in the mid-'60s Beatlemania swept the globe. The rest of the decade was defined by fearless experimentation, musical reinvention, and visionary recordings. Years after their 1970 breakup, The Beatles continue to be a keystone influence on countless artists. This selection of unforgettable songs—now highlighting some of the most revelatory tracks from the new super deluxe White Album collection—offers an introduction to the band's towering legacy for new listeners, and an opportunity for longtime fans to fall in love with them all over again.",

The album was a stark contrast to <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> in every aspect—from the cover art to the sounds within. The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

                            "standard": "For better and worse, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it.",

                            "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

                            "standard": "While it’s romantic to imagine that <i>Revolver</i> was a bolt of genius that arrived without context or precedent, the reality is more interesting. Sometime in 1965, The Beatles' longtime producer George Martin quit his contract with EMI Records. Martin had been working at a flat rate, without royalties—in other words, he would’ve made what he made no matter how well the band did. Martin knew EMI wouldn’t risk jeopardizing the band’s streak, and in leaving, he essentially forced the company to pay him what he was worth. That EMI owned the studios at Abbey Road outright meant The Beatles could record more or less as much as they wanted—an opportunity that, coupled with their increasing reluctance to tour, marked an existential shift in orientation: The Beatles were a studio band now.<br />\nWhat was once a refuge (the band liked recording in part because it gave them a break from the fatigue of touring and public fame) turned into a hub of inspiration. Some results were obvious: the wild tape-loop collages of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” or George Harrison's guitar solo on “I’m Only Sleeping,” made during a six-hour session in which the part was transcribed in reverse by Martin, then recorded with the tape playing backward so as to make the final product sound like it was being sucked out from inside the song. Others—compression, Leslie speakers that gave vocals a liquid, sloshing quality, and automatic double-tracking capacity that allowed the band to split signals across the stereo field and give the recordings new spatial dimension—were subtler, but in all cases pointed to a supremacy of sound for sound’s sake. The pastiche of faces and lack of band attribution on the album’s cover drove home the point: For all the 300-something hours that went into the album’s recording, it’s hard to picture <i>Revolver</i> being made by four guys standing in a room.<br />\nWhile McCartney was getting more interested in characters and scenarios (“For No One,” “Eleanor Rigby”), Lennon—then starting to steep in LSD—was withdrawing into the mysteries of the self (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”). Harrison, previously a little peripheral, found not only a voice, but range: Compare the serrated R&B of “Taxman” to the Indian drones of “Love You To”—a contrast as stark as any in the band’s catalog.<br />\nIn a way, it’s understandable why the album was considered minor compared to <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> for so long: <i>Pepper’s</i> had a rambling, mythic quality that made it seem like something more than just a set of songs, while <i>Revolver</i> was still essentially following the rubric of <i>Rubber Soul</i>—a compact set of tracks meant to show the best ideas the band had. But if <i>Pepper’s</i> liberated the concept of the big, sprawling rock album, <i>Revolver</i> still speaks to how we understand 21st-century pop: fragmented, super eclectic, each song a fully saturated mood different from the one three minutes in either direction. Where <i>Pepper’s</i> ambled, <i>Revolver</i> honored the entertainer’s timeless responsibility to grab you by the ears.<br />\nLess than a week after the album was released, the band held a press conference at the Astor Hotel in Chicago, where Lennon was inevitably forced to clarify his observation from the previous March that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus—a comment controversial enough to be publicly denounced by the Vatican, who noted that some subjects should be respected even by beatniks. A few questions later, a member of the press noted—respectfully in both directions—that Jesus probably would have appreciated “Eleanor Rigby.” Lennon, so exhausted and troubled by the ordeal that he’d broken down in tears while preparing to meet the reporters, demurred.",

The album was a stark contrast to <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> in every aspect—from the cover art to the sounds within. The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

                                            "standard": "While it’s romantic to imagine that <i>Revolver</i> was a bolt of genius that arrived without context or precedent, the reality is more interesting. Sometime in 1965, The Beatles' longtime producer George Martin quit his contract with EMI Records. Martin had been working at a flat rate, without royalties—in other words, he would’ve made what he made no matter how well the band did. Martin knew EMI wouldn’t risk jeopardizing the band’s streak, and in leaving, he essentially forced the company to pay him what he was worth. That EMI owned the studios at Abbey Road outright meant The Beatles could record more or less as much as they wanted—an opportunity that, coupled with their increasing reluctance to tour, marked an existential shift in orientation: The Beatles were a studio band now.<br />\nWhat was once a refuge (the band liked recording in part because it gave them a break from the fatigue of touring and public fame) turned into a hub of inspiration. Some results were obvious: the wild tape-loop collages of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” or George Harrison's guitar solo on “I’m Only Sleeping,” made during a six-hour session in which the part was transcribed in reverse by Martin, then recorded with the tape playing backward so as to make the final product sound like it was being sucked out from inside the song. Others—compression, Leslie speakers that gave vocals a liquid, sloshing quality, and automatic double-tracking capacity that allowed the band to split signals across the stereo field and give the recordings new spatial dimension—were subtler, but in all cases pointed to a supremacy of sound for sound’s sake. The pastiche of faces and lack of band attribution on the album’s cover drove home the point: For all the 300-something hours that went into the album’s recording, it’s hard to picture <i>Revolver</i> being made by four guys standing in a room.<br />\nWhile McCartney was getting more interested in characters and scenarios (“For No One,” “Eleanor Rigby”), Lennon—then starting to steep in LSD—was withdrawing into the mysteries of the self (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”). Harrison, previously a little peripheral, found not only a voice, but range: Compare the serrated R&B of “Taxman” to the Indian drones of “Love You To”—a contrast as stark as any in the band’s catalog.<br />\nIn a way, it’s understandable why the album was considered minor compared to <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> for so long: <i>Pepper’s</i> had a rambling, mythic quality that made it seem like something more than just a set of songs, while <i>Revolver</i> was still essentially following the rubric of <i>Rubber Soul</i>—a compact set of tracks meant to show the best ideas the band had. But if <i>Pepper’s</i> liberated the concept of the big, sprawling rock album, <i>Revolver</i> still speaks to how we understand 21st-century pop: fragmented, super eclectic, each song a fully saturated mood different from the one three minutes in either direction. Where <i>Pepper’s</i> ambled, <i>Revolver</i> honored the entertainer’s timeless responsibility to grab you by the ears.<br />\nLess than a week after the album was released, the band held a press conference at the Astor Hotel in Chicago, where Lennon was inevitably forced to clarify his observation from the previous March that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus—a comment controversial enough to be publicly denounced by the Vatican, who noted that some subjects should be respected even by beatniks. A few questions later, a member of the press noted—respectfully in both directions—that Jesus probably would have appreciated “Eleanor Rigby.” Lennon, so exhausted and troubled by the ordeal that he’d broken down in tears while preparing to meet the reporters, demurred.",

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it.",
