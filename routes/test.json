Shortly after the group's lineup solidified in 1961, a series of wildly successful singles made them superstars, and in the mid-'60s Beatlemania swept the globe. The rest of the decade was defined by fearless experimentation, musical reinvention, and visionary recordings. Years after their 1970 breakup, The Beatles continue to be a keystone influence on countless artists. This selection of unforgettable songs—now highlighting some of the most revelatory tracks from the new super deluxe White Album collection—offers an introduction to the band's towering legacy for new listeners, and an opportunity for longtime fans to fall in love with them all over again.",

                            "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

                            "standard": "While it’s romantic to imagine that <i>Revolver</i> was a bolt of genius that arrived without context or precedent, the reality is more interesting. Sometime in 1965, The Beatles' longtime producer George Martin quit his contract with EMI Records. Martin had been working at a flat rate, without royalties—in other words, he would’ve made what he made no matter how well the band did. Martin knew EMI wouldn’t risk jeopardizing the band’s streak, and in leaving, he essentially forced the company to pay him what he was worth. That EMI owned the studios at Abbey Road outright meant The Beatles could record more or less as much as they wanted—an opportunity that, coupled with their increasing reluctance to tour, marked an existential shift in orientation: The Beatles were a studio band now.<br />\nWhat was once a refuge (the band liked recording in part because it gave them a break from the fatigue of touring and public fame) turned into a hub of inspiration. Some results were obvious: the wild tape-loop collages of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” or George Harrison's guitar solo on “I’m Only Sleeping,” made during a six-hour session in which the part was transcribed in reverse by Martin, then recorded with the tape playing backward so as to make the final product sound like it was being sucked out from inside the song. Others—compression, Leslie speakers that gave vocals a liquid, sloshing quality, and automatic double-tracking capacity that allowed the band to split signals across the stereo field and give the recordings new spatial dimension—were subtler, but in all cases pointed to a supremacy of sound for sound’s sake. The pastiche of faces and lack of band attribution on the album’s cover drove home the point: For all the 300-something hours that went into the album’s recording, it’s hard to picture <i>Revolver</i> being made by four guys standing in a room.<br />\nWhile McCartney was getting more interested in characters and scenarios (“For No One,” “Eleanor Rigby”), Lennon—then starting to steep in LSD—was withdrawing into the mysteries of the self (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”). Harrison, previously a little peripheral, found not only a voice, but range: Compare the serrated R&B of “Taxman” to the Indian drones of “Love You To”—a contrast as stark as any in the band’s catalog.<br />\nIn a way, it’s understandable why the album was considered minor compared to <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> for so long: <i>Pepper’s</i> had a rambling, mythic quality that made it seem like something more than just a set of songs, while <i>Revolver</i> was still essentially following the rubric of <i>Rubber Soul</i>—a compact set of tracks meant to show the best ideas the band had. But if <i>Pepper’s</i> liberated the concept of the big, sprawling rock album, <i>Revolver</i> still speaks to how we understand 21st-century pop: fragmented, super eclectic, each song a fully saturated mood different from the one three minutes in either direction. Where <i>Pepper’s</i> ambled, <i>Revolver</i> honored the entertainer’s timeless responsibility to grab you by the ears.<br />\nLess than a week after the album was released, the band held a press conference at the Astor Hotel in Chicago, where Lennon was inevitably forced to clarify his observation from the previous March that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus—a comment controversial enough to be publicly denounced by the Vatican, who noted that some subjects should be respected even by beatniks. A few questions later, a member of the press noted—respectfully in both directions—that Jesus probably would have appreciated “Eleanor Rigby.” Lennon, so exhausted and troubled by the ordeal that he’d broken down in tears while preparing to meet the reporters, demurred.",

                            "standard": "If <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> and <i>Beatles For Sale</i> sounded like a band chafing at the confines of their own success, <i>Help!</i> was more like a meditation: four people seeking solace from inside a storm they’d never seen gather. Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans. When security guards turned the girls away, they went home, opened the Yellow Pages, and rented a helicopter. <i>Help!</i>—that sounds right.",

Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension. Asked why he thought people didn’t like it, McCartney said he wasn’t sure—he liked it fine.",

The album was a stark contrast to <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> in every aspect—from the cover art to the sounds within. The sheer breadth of material as well as the mixture of the loud and the soft is part of what makes \"The White Album\" so surprising. The heavy sounds of \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Yer Blues\" juxtapose with the gentle beauty of \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Julia.\" The cacophony of \"Revolution 9\" is followed by the orchestral lullaby of \"Good Night.\" The album's extended length gave the band room in which they could explore all of their musical influences and multiple forms of popular music, while creating revolutionary sounds in the studio.",

As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real.",

                                            "standard": "While it’s romantic to imagine that <i>Revolver</i> was a bolt of genius that arrived without context or precedent, the reality is more interesting. Sometime in 1965, The Beatles' longtime producer George Martin quit his contract with EMI Records. Martin had been working at a flat rate, without royalties—in other words, he would’ve made what he made no matter how well the band did. Martin knew EMI wouldn’t risk jeopardizing the band’s streak, and in leaving, he essentially forced the company to pay him what he was worth. That EMI owned the studios at Abbey Road outright meant The Beatles could record more or less as much as they wanted—an opportunity that, coupled with their increasing reluctance to tour, marked an existential shift in orientation: The Beatles were a studio band now.<br />\nWhat was once a refuge (the band liked recording in part because it gave them a break from the fatigue of touring and public fame) turned into a hub of inspiration. Some results were obvious: the wild tape-loop collages of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” or George Harrison's guitar solo on “I’m Only Sleeping,” made during a six-hour session in which the part was transcribed in reverse by Martin, then recorded with the tape playing backward so as to make the final product sound like it was being sucked out from inside the song. Others—compression, Leslie speakers that gave vocals a liquid, sloshing quality, and automatic double-tracking capacity that allowed the band to split signals across the stereo field and give the recordings new spatial dimension—were subtler, but in all cases pointed to a supremacy of sound for sound’s sake. The pastiche of faces and lack of band attribution on the album’s cover drove home the point: For all the 300-something hours that went into the album’s recording, it’s hard to picture <i>Revolver</i> being made by four guys standing in a room.<br />\nWhile McCartney was getting more interested in characters and scenarios (“For No One,” “Eleanor Rigby”), Lennon—then starting to steep in LSD—was withdrawing into the mysteries of the self (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”). Harrison, previously a little peripheral, found not only a voice, but range: Compare the serrated R&B of “Taxman” to the Indian drones of “Love You To”—a contrast as stark as any in the band’s catalog.<br />\nIn a way, it’s understandable why the album was considered minor compared to <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> for so long: <i>Pepper’s</i> had a rambling, mythic quality that made it seem like something more than just a set of songs, while <i>Revolver</i> was still essentially following the rubric of <i>Rubber Soul</i>—a compact set of tracks meant to show the best ideas the band had. But if <i>Pepper’s</i> liberated the concept of the big, sprawling rock album, <i>Revolver</i> still speaks to how we understand 21st-century pop: fragmented, super eclectic, each song a fully saturated mood different from the one three minutes in either direction. Where <i>Pepper’s</i> ambled, <i>Revolver</i> honored the entertainer’s timeless responsibility to grab you by the ears.<br />\nLess than a week after the album was released, the band held a press conference at the Astor Hotel in Chicago, where Lennon was inevitably forced to clarify his observation from the previous March that The Beatles had become more popular than Jesus—a comment controversial enough to be publicly denounced by the Vatican, who noted that some subjects should be respected even by beatniks. A few questions later, a member of the press noted—respectfully in both directions—that Jesus probably would have appreciated “Eleanor Rigby.” Lennon, so exhausted and troubled by the ordeal that he’d broken down in tears while preparing to meet the reporters, demurred.",

Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans. When security guards turned the girls away, they went home, opened the Yellow Pages, and rented a helicopter. <i>Help!</i>—that sounds right.",

Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension. Asked why he thought people didn’t like it, McCartney said he wasn’t sure—he liked it fine.",
